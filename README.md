### On Air. WTF?

Let me answer your beautiful question by parts.  

2.  **What is this?** An amazing On Air sign. The app you were waiting for.

4.  **Who the hell needs this shit?** Everyone. More importantly super low budget radios, and (like in my case) a very loud digital agancy that needed a visual cue to be silent while someone is in call with a client.

6.  **Why does it look like it was designed by a 5 years old?**[@huemulaa](http://twitter.com/huemulaa) said she was going to design it. So, talk to her, it's not my fault.

8.  **Why did you build this piece of crap?** Because building crappy sites is much easier than building good ones. And I don't know how to code.

Thanks!
